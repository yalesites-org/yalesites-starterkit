For example, a succinct speaker bio in a <strong>Content Spotlight</strong> or <strong>Wrapped Image Block </strong>could make your listing more appealing and help potential attendees get a better sense of what your event will be like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need to share a collection of images, like when promoting an exhibition, use <strong>Image Grid Block</strong> or <strong>Gallery Block</strong>. Select the Gallery block when you'd like visitors to be able to view larger versions of your images or when you need to provide captions and image attribution.</p>\r\n"
