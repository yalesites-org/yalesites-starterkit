      value: "<h2>How it works</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Say you're creating an Academics section on your website that contains several sub-pages. Add an 'academics' tag to each of your pages. Then, place a View of Pages on your landing page and set it to only include content that uses the term 'academics.' Your View will automatically update whenever you publish or unpublish a page tagged 'academics.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conversely, you can build a View by excluding terms, as we've done here. Our homepage and landing page are tagged 'example' to remove them from our View. Try editing the example View Block's settings so you can see how it works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach can be used to curate any published content type. For example, you can make a featured news area on your homepage, highlight marquee events or create a custom Profile directory.</p>\r\n"
