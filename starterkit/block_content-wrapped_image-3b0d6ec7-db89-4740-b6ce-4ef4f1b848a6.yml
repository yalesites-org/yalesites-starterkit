      value: "<h2 id=\"blocks\">Building with Blocks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Blocks</strong> are robust, pre-designed components used to display and customize the content on your website. We typically break web pages into sections, such as the header, body, and footer. Blocks extend this by breaking your <em>content</em> into individual, self-contained pieces. A heading and paragraph become a Text Block, a photo becomes an Image Block, and so on. Embracing this new approach empowers editors to shift their focus to content rather than creating and maintaining code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before, adjusting the position or style of content like this <strong>Wrapped Image Block</strong> might require an editor to cut and paste code, leading to frustrating formatting issues or broken pages. Now, the image and text are contained within a single Block. Change the position or outset of the image by adjusting the Block's settings, or drag and drop the Block to move it to another section of your page.</p>\r\n"
