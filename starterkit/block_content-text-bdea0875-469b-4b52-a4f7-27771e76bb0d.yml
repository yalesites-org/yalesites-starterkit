      value: "<h2>The Text Block</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Text Block</strong> uses a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor that allows you to enter and edit your text in a visual, user-friendly way. The WYSIWYG text editor behaves like word processing software. It will display your text as it appears on the website, so you can see what the formatting will look like as you work. You can easily <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> your text, add headings, select text to create links, insert ordered and unordered lists, and insert a table.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Help your users with headings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Use headings to organize your content. This makes it easier for the reader to understand and navigate the information you share. To use headings effectively, consider your content's overall structure and hierarchy, and then divide it into sections and sub-sections using headings and nested subheadings.</p>\r\n"
