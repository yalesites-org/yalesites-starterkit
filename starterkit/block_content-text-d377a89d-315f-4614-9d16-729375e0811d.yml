      value: "<h2>Prompt your users to take action</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that people are more likely to complete an action when prompted to do so. This prompt is referred to as a <strong>call to action</strong>. Calls to action can take many forms, from a simple text link to a full-width banner. Whatever your approach, you dramatically increase the likelihood of your audience understanding what next steps you'd like them to take when the process is easy and obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We designed YaleSites' Blocks to make adding and maintaining visually engaging calls to action as easy as possible, whether you have images or not. In fact, the <strong>Callout Block</strong> used on this page is an excellent text-based approach for promoting your page's call to action.</p>\r\n"
